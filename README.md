# LayoutToImage
Converting a Layout to Image and saving it in a Specific Folder in Android.
Firstly We will convert Layout in to a Bitmap. 
Using Canvas we will assign height and width to our Bitmap. 
Bitamp will be saved in a Specific named Folder in Pictures Directory. 
That's you are done...Happy Coding :)
